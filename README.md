# CricketMatch

This is a simple cricket match simulation using user input. In my hall, there will be a cricket tournament. I've made this project so that I can calculate all the match results and summaries. Further instruction will be provided along with the code.

A sample input is given with this repository. The output is also given in two ways. One is along with input and others are just output.
